# GymTracker

**GymTracker** is a Java-based application designed to help users track their workouts and monitor their progress over time. The main goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and flexible tool for recording gym sessions, with a focus on clean data organization, visual progress tracking, and future-proof extensibility.

This project is primarily for learning purposes and is part of my personal portfolio.
