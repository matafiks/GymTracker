# GymTracker
A console application (future plans: GUI with JavaFX and save to database) to track workouts and monitor progress in the gym. Users can add their daily workouts, exercises, and sets to keep a clear record of their training sessions over time.

  Display your max (or personal best) lift for a specific exercise.
- **Future Plans**
    - Graphical User Interface (JavaFX)
    - Database integration for persistent data storage
    - Docker containerization for easier deployment
    - PDF reports or export options
    - More detailed statistics (e.g. volume per session, average intensity)
    - Generate charts or reports showing progress over time.
